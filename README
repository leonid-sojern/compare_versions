Installation:
You need to have a ruby interpreter installed.

To run the script standalone:
Start irb in the terminal, "irb"
Within "irb", type: load 'cmp.ruby'

Now, the functions defined in the file are available.

You can now run comparisons, e.g., 
cmp("2", "3")

Considerations:
I allowed versions to either include or not include the dot character.
I assumed that the input format is valid (the input is not validated).
If the input is not validated, an error would be thrown.

I assumed that all numbers are properly formed and don't start with the leading zeros.
